Syngenta Crop Challenge
=======================

This year, in conjunction with the [INFORMS Conference on Business
Analytics and Operations Research](http://meetings2.informs.org/wordpress/analytics2016/),
[INFORMS](http://informs.org) and [Syngenta](http://syngenta.com)
sponsored the first annual [Syngenta Crop Challenge in Analytics](https://www.ideaconnection.com/syngenta-crop-challenge/). From the [University of Iowa](http://uiowa.edu)
[Tippie College of Business](http://tippie.uiowa.edu), Ling Tong, Bhupesh Shetty,
and I formed a team and entered the contest.

Ling is a senior in the Business Analytics and Information Systems
major, and Bhupesh is a third-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of
Management Sciences](http://tippie.uiowa.edu/management-sciences). Our
submission used a clever mixture of data wrangling, statistics, and
optimization to recommend an efficient frontier of soybean portfolios
balancing expected yield and risk due to weather. We used all open-source
tools such as [R](http://cran.r-project.org), [Cbc](https://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc),
[Julia](http://julialang.org), and [JuMP](http://www.juliaopt.org).

And...we won third place! There were a total of 36 teams from around
the world, and the top two teams came from Stanford University (Earth
Sciences and CS departments) and Bosch Corporation (research arm in
India). Our placement was based in part on a written report and
