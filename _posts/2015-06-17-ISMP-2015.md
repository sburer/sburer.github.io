The ISMP Graph
==============

Every three years, the [Mathematical Optimization
Society](http://mathopt.org) meets for its [International Symposium of
Mathematical Programming](http://ismp2015.org), or *ISMP*, which is the
flagship meeting of mathematical optimizers throughout the world. This
year the 22nd ISMP is being held July 12-17 in Pittsburgh.

To visualize the contributions and connections between groups in
the optimization community (just for fun!), I downloaded all of the
program information for the 22nd ISMP. This included all sessions, all
session chairs, and all presenters. I defined a group of participants
to be those from the same institution (e.g., university or company)
as determined by the domain name in a participants's email address.
(However, I ignored generic domains such as *gmail.com*.) Then, for each
group, I counted how many sessions in which it participated, and for
every pair of groups, I also counted how many sessions in which that
pair participated together.

I then plotted the groups as points geographically with the point
size indicating the group's participation frequency, and I also drew
great-circle connections to indicate the pairs that participated
together. A connection's thickness and opacity indicates the pair's
participation frequency. The final plot is shown below.
