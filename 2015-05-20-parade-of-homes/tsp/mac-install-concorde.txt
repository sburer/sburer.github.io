Introduction: No tutorial online gives up-to-date instructions about how to install concorde on a mac. This
document intends to fill that gap.

Step 0. Make sure your mac has a working c compiler. Xcode uses clang, but tutorials online say you need gcc
Clang is fine. Type "cc" in the terminal to make sure it is installed. If not, the computer will prompt you
to install Xcode terminal tools. Go ahead and install it.

Step 1. Download concorde from here: http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/concorde/downloads/codes/src/co031219.tgz
Untar it to the desired location. The directory will be called "concorde"

Setp 2. Donwload the Linear Programming solver here: http://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~wcook/qsopt/beta/index.html
you want the qsopt.a and qsopt.h files. Make sure you use the 64 bit mac verions of the files.
Store those in a directory somewhere. For the purposes of this note, we will call the directory "QSOPT"

Step 3. cd to the concorde directory

Step 4. In the terminal type: 

export QSOPTDIR=path/to/QSOPT
export CFLAGS="-g -O3 -arch x86_64"
./configure --with-qsopt=$QSOPTDIR --host=darwin
make

Step 6. To test it, download a tsp instance from here: http://www.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/groups/comopt/software/TSPLIB95/tsp/

I used d493.tsp

Step 7. cd to "concorde/TSP/" then execute "./concorde path/to/d493.tsp" My macbook retina (the one that came out
before the recent haswell processor version) uses OSX version 10.9.1 and has a dual core i7 with 8GB ram.
It solved d493.tsp in 48.62 seconds.
